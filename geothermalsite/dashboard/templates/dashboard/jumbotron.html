    <p>Carleton's geothermal database is large and complex! Here are a few things to know:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>This database contains many outages, so certain searches may have unexpected contours. <u><a class="link" href="{% url 'documentation' %}">Find out more about data outages.</a></u></li>
        <li>This database is big, so searching for data over long periods of time may take a few seconds and up to a few minutes. Please be patient!</li>
        <li>This is an ongoing project and there are many features we hope are implemented in the future! <u><a class="link" href="{% url 'about' %}">Read more about future directions.</a></u></li>
    </ul>
