    <p>One of the difficulties (and joys!) of working with Carleton's Geothermal data is its size and complexity. Here are a few things to know:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>This database contains many outages, so certain searches will contain gaps. <a href="{% url 'documentation' %}">Find out more about data outages.</a></li>
        <li>This database is big, so searching for data over longer periods of time will, well, take longer! Some may take a matter of seconds, others minutes. Please be patient!</li>
        <li>This is an ongoing project, so there are many features we hope are implemented in the future.</li>
    </ul>
